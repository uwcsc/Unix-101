## To log into the lab machines:
user: csc03
pass: Nux30817

## Why people use the shell :woman_shrugging:
The **shell** (also called **terminal**, or **command line**, I'll be using these interchangeably) is really powerful, a lot more powerful than programs with GUI's (Graphical User Interfaces).

Lots of programs only really work from the command line, and almost every software professional :woman_technologist: knows their way around it. 

It's a critical skill to have :moneybag:. Also you can look like a leet hacker.

## Basics of shell interaction
**If you don't know how to do something, just google it. Practice is a great way to level up your google-fu, and that's a cirtical skill**!

You can also do `man command_name` to read the manual for a command, or try `command_name -h` or `command_name --help`. 

### Opening the terminal
Linux :penguin:: On Ubuntu, Ctrl+Alt+T will open a terminal. Or try Alt+F2 and type in `terminal` or `gnome-terminal`.  Otherwise, this might depend on your Linux distribution. If you're using the CSCF computers, and your terminal has a `%` in it, type `bash` and hit enter to open up the bash shell.

MacOS :apple:: Open up the application called Terminal (you can use Cmd+Space and type in Terminal). In the future, if you start to use the terminal more, you may want to install [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/), as it's nicer and more powerful than the default.

### The terminal prompt
When you open the terminal, you will see something like this (The screenshot was taken on Ubuntu 17.04):

![Terminal Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zvory/Unix-101/master/TerminalScreenshot.png)

This is the **terminal prompt**. This is where you enter commands. You can see there's some text there already, the terminal will print this out when it's ready to accept commands from you, the default text it prints out is:

`username@machine-name:your-working-directory`

You might see that the `your-working-directory` part of the prompt is `~`. In the terminal, `~` is shorthand for your **home directory**.

### Hello world (echo) :speaking_head:

Let's try to print "Hello world!". The terminal command to display a line of text is `echo`. So lets put this command into the terminal:

`echo "Hello world!"`

And press enter. You should see the text "Hello world!" printed back at you.

Congrats :tada:, you've made a Hello world! program in the terminal.

Here's a breakdown of what you just did:

`echo` is the name of the program you're running. `echo` takes what's called **arguments**, this is the input to the program. In this case, we're inputting `"Hello world!"` as the first and only argument. Echo can take multiple arguments, why don't you try getting that to work?

### Creating a file (touch) :point_down:
Let's make a file. In a GUI program with a nice user interface, we might right click in the file explorer, and click 'New File', but we can't do that in the terminal.

Instead, we will use a command called `touch`. This will create an empty file for us. Let's type `touch myFile.txt` into the terminal.

Once you've done that, you might notice you don't get any feedback, there's nothing that says "File created successfully" or anything, you just see a new prompt to enter a new command. This is normal, in Unix there is a convention that **if a program doesn't output anything, it executed successfully**.

### Finding the file we just created (ls) :mag:
Remember the `your-working-directory` part of the terminal prompt we talked about earlier? That is where your terminal is currently open to. When we used `touch`, the file we created was created in `your-working-directory`.

Lets list the files in our current directory. To do this, we use the command called `ls` 

 > :speech_balloon: `ls` Sounds kinda like "list". Often times Unix commands will be really short, like `rm` instead of "remove", this is so you have to type less).

At this point, our terminal might look something like this (The specific files and folders you see will probably be different from mine):

![Terminal Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zvory/Unix-101/master/lsOutput.png)

After we use the `ls` command, we will see a bunch of file and folder names in our terminal.

Most importantly, we will see the name of the file we created earlier, `myFile.txt`.

### Printing the file we created (less, cat) :page_facing_up:
To print a file, we can use either `cat` (which stands for concatenate) or `less` (the opposite of `more`, which is an old file viewer program).

As you might expect, to view the file we created type in `less myFile.txt` or `cat myFile.txt`. 

> :speech_balloon: Note, you don't have to type in the entire filename, try typing in `less myF` and then press the Tab key. Your shell will try to autocomplete the filename, saving you time. Your shell will also try to do this with directories.

### Editing the file (nano, vim, emacs) :writing_hand:
To edit the file, we'll use a simple editor called `nano`. Most people don't use `nano` for anything but quick editing jobs, but editors that run in the terminal are notoriously unintuitive (however, it's still strongly recommended to learn how to use a terminal editor like `vim` or `emacs`).

`nano myFile.txt`

Once here, type in some text, then press Ctrl+x to exit the program, then type in `Y` to save the file when you're prompted. Then, `nano` will ask you what file to write to, just press enter to default to `myFile.txt`.

Print the file again using either `less` or `cat`, and you should see the text you just entered.

### Directories (pwd) :file_folder:
In Unix systems, your **files are organized in directories**. To see the current directory you are working in, use the `pwd` command. It will print a **path** which looks something like:

`/user/azvorygi`

You can read a path by starting from the left and going right. In order:
 - First is the "root" `/` directory. This is the root of your file system. All files and folders are in `/`.
 - `/` Contains `user/`
 - `user/` contains the directory `azvorygi/`, which is where you currently are (your "working directory"). `azvorygi` is my username, so you'll probably see some other username there.
 
### Creating a folder (mkdir) :open_file_folder:
Let's create a folder. The command for this is `mkdir`.

`mkdir my-folder`

> :speech_balloon: Files in Unix systems can contains, dots, dashes, or even emoji ðŸ˜ƒ!. You can even have spaces, but that's [a little more complicated](https://www.hecticgeek.com/2014/02/spaces-file-names-command-line/).

Now, lets check the contents of our current directory. Try to remember the command to do that. If you don't remember, it's `ls`.

You should see somewhere in the output of `ls` your new folder.

### Copying and renaming files (cp, mv) :truck:
Let's copy `myFile.txt` to `my-folder`. To do that we use the `cp` (copy) command. 

`cp` takes some arguments: some source files, and a destination. Our source file is `myFile.txt`, our destination is `my-folder`. Altogether:

`cp myFile.txt my-folder`

As before, there should be no output if the command succeeded as expected, and if something went wrong it will print out some errors.

Now, let's do a more advanced use of `ls`. Try typing in `ls my-folder`. This should list the contents of the `my-folder` directory. We can see `ls` also takes an **optional argument**, which is the directory to list.

If you just use the `ls` command without specifying `my-folder`, `myFile.txt` is still present in the current directory. This is because we copied `myFile.txt`, the original remains in place.

To move a file, use `mv` (move), it works much the same as `cp`, except it deletes the original copy of the file. 

> :speech_balloon: You can use `mv` to rename a file: `mv oldFileName newFileName`.

### Changing directories (cd) :airplane:
Lets go to this new folder we created. The command for that is `cd` (change directory).

`cd my-folder`.

If you use `pwd`, you should see your working directory has changed to the new directory (something like `/user/azvorygi/my-folder`. If you use `ls`, you should see just the file `myFile.txt`. 

Lets go back to your home directory now. But instead of doing `cd /user/azvorygi` lets do `cd ..`. In the terminal, `..` means "go up one directory". So if you wanted to go up two directories, you could write `cd ../..`. Alternatively, you could write `cd ~` to go back to your home directory. 

> :speech_balloon: Remember that `~` refers to your home directory in the terminal. We could write something like `cd ~/my-folder` if we wanted to.

### Deleting directories and files (rm, rmdir) :no_entry:
Now that we are back in our home directory, lets delete `my-folder`. We'll use the `rmdir` (remove directory) command.

`rmdir my-folder`

:exclamation: Oh no, an error message!
`rmdir: failed to remove 'my-folder/': Directory not empty`

Ahh, we should delete the `myFile.txt` we put in the directory. We'll use the `rm` (remove) command.

`rm my-folder/myFile.txt`

Now lets try to use the `rmdir` command again:

`rmdir my-folder`

If `rmdir` doesn't error, when you type in `ls` you should not see `my-folder`.

> :boom: :bangbang: `rm` is NOT undoable. This ain't windows with a recycle bin. Be careful and *always* double check what you're about to rm. You can do things like `rm /` (remember `/` is the root directory, so you could delete your entire hard drive by accident) and it's undoable!

### Installing a command/program/package (apt, apt-get, brew) :construction_worker:

On Ubuntu, or similar linux distributions, to install a package or command, we use the command `apt`. This is Ubuntu's *Advanced Packaging Tool*.

To install the package `sl` (steam locomotive):

`sudo apt install sl`

You'll notice the `sudo` before the `apt install sl`. `sudo` means "run the following command as a superuser". Not just any user can install programs, you need the right security priviliges to install this program. If you're on a CSCF machine, or other machine you don't control, you won't have the sudo password and wont be able to install programs.

> :speech_balloon: In old systems, or in lots of online documentation, the command `apt-get` is used instead of `apt`. They're basically equivalent, but `apt` is the new and improved version.

After it's done installing, let's use the command, but I won't spoil the surprise of what it does!


> :apple: For MacOS, you'll be using a program called [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install programs. The command you'll use is `brew install` to install programs, but I won't cover how to install Homebrew here.

### Your command history (history) :book:

To see the history of the commands you've run, use the `history` command.

### Mildly interesting demo (ssh)
We're going to use `ssh` to log into one of the Computer Science Club computers. 

`ssh unix101@corn-syrup.csclub.uwaterloo.ca`

(I'll give you the password IRL).

Then run `htop` (or `node test.js`).

### Further learning! :fireworks:
I'll provide a list of useful commands, programs or concepts that will be useful in your journey to Unix mastership:
 - `head`, `tail`, if you don't want to see everything in a large file, you can use this to print the first/last *n* lines of a file. Example use: `head myFile.txt`.
 - `ssh`, [is used to remotely access another computer](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/command/). This is extensively used, and `ssh` backs a lot of services.
 - `git`, [is used for version control](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/). If you plan to be in software, you *will* use `git` in your career. 
 - `tmux`, [is used to have multiple panels open in one terminal window, or keeping sessions running](https://hackernoon.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-tmux-8d784c404340). 
 - `scp`, [is like `cp`, but you can use it over networks](http://www.hypexr.org/linux_scp_help.php)
 - `vim`, is a very powerful and common terminal text editor.
 - `wget`/`curl` are very similar programs that are used to download files off the internet. Try using `wget http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~azvorygi/wget`
 - `.bash_aliases` you can put useful aliases here. For example, I added in `alias l='ls'`, and now I can type `l` instead of `ls`.
 - `grep`, is used for searching text. 
 - [Hidden files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory)
